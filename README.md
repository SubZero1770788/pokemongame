 I've undertook creation of this project in order to learn more about creating API and developmnet in technologies listed below


## Technologies Used
- C#
- ASP.NET CORE
- Entity Framework

- TypeScript
- Angular

## Features
- Data in database is secured by Identity
- The game contains battle system in  which player can battle with wild pokemon
- User can catch, train and fight with pokemon. 
- Each pokemon has its own list of attacks with different stats,
- Pokemons can evolve and learn new attacks 

## Usage
It's an online game so anyone can play it if they want it. In further development there's certainly a place for monetization

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_ / _in development_. Although the project is complete and working, I intend on adding new features such as battles between users and games 
which can be joined through main account so user doesn't have to create account each time points run out.


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- refactor of controllers,
- better responsiveness

To do:
